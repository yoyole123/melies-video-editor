Building your app
Adding and Using NPM Packages

Extend your app with pre-built code libraries.
Important: NPM packages are only available for apps using the new infrastructure.
​
What are NPM packages?
NPM packages let you add powerful features and tools to your Base44 applications without having to build everything yourself. You can access reliable, up-to-date code libraries for things like animations, data formatting, and charts, all created by expert developers. When you use NPM packages, you can add advanced features in minutes, rely on well-tested code, and focus on creating what makes your app unique.
Think of NPM packages as little boxes of ready-made code you can plug into your app. Someone else already wrote the code. You just need to install the package and can use all its abilities instantly.
Base44 makes it simple to add NPM packages to your app. You can request to add NPM packages, review the request, and approve installation, all from the AI chat inside your app editor.
Examples of NPM packages

    Animation libraries (for example, anime.js)
    Chart and graph utilities
    Date and time helpers
    UI components
    Drag and drop logic

Important:NPM packages are created and maintained by third parties. Base44 can’t guarantee the quality, reliability, or security of any external package you install. Always test and validate packages carefully to make sure they work correctly in your app. You are responsible for ensuring that any third-party packages you use meet your project’s needs.
​
Browsing NPM packages
You can find NPM packages in the public registry. Each package README includes detailed instructions, usage examples, and peer dependency details, so you can get started right away.
Use the Base44 NPM Playground to preview npm packages in action and plug them directly into your app.
To browse Base44 NPM packages:

    Go to npmjs.com to see all available public packages.
    Click the package you want to use to open its details page.

Adding an NPM package to your app
In Base44, you can add NPM packages by chatting with the AI. No terminal or manual install commands required. To add an NPM package to your app:

    Go to your app editor.
    Type in the AI chat the NPM package you want to install.
    When prompted, click Approve in the chat.

Example of using an NPM package
You can use anime.js to create polished entrance animations for your app’s pages and elements. For example, you might want to animate cards, buttons, or charts when a page loads to make your site feel more engaging. Simply add a prompt such as:

Install the NPM anime.js and make my app beautiful

The AI chat will ask you to approve the installation and the package is installed right into your app.
